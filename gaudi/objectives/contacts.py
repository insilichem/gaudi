"""
This objective provides a wrapper around Chimera's
`DetectClash` that detects clashes and contacts.

Clashes are understood as steric conflicts that increases the energy
of the system. They are evaluated as the sum of volumetric overlapping
of the Van der Waals' spheres of the implied atoms.

Contacts are considered as stabilizing, and they are evaluated with a
Lennard-Jones 12-6 like function.

    Contacts class

    Parameters
    ----------
    probes : str
        Name of molecule gene that is object of contacts analysis
    radius : float
        Maximum distance from any point of probes that is searched
        for possible interactions
    which : {'hydrophobic', 'clashes'}
        Type of interactions to measure
    clash_threshold : float, optional
        Maximum overlap of van-der-Waals spheres that is considered as
        a contact (attractive). If the overlap is greater, it's 
        considered a clash (repulsive)
    hydrophobic_threshold : float, optional
        Maximum overlap for hydrophobic patches.
    hydrophobic_elements : list of str, optional, defaults to [C, S]
        Which elements are allowed to interact in hydrophobic patches
    cutoff : float, optional
        If the overlap volume is greater than this, a penalty is applied. 
        Useful to filter bad solutions.
    bond_separation : int, optional
        Ignore clashes or contacts between atoms within n bonds.

    -------
